According to [R.Hinze](/Papers/FunWithPhantomTypes.pdf#page=8), the term [Phantom Type](/Papers/leijen.pdf#page=8) was coined by Leijen and Meijer "to denote parameterized types that do not use their type argument." Leijen and Meijer also use this technique in another paper w/ SPJ and Sigbjorn Finne "Calling Hell From Heaven and Heaven From Hell". [Section 5.1](/Papers/CallingHellFromHeavenAndHeavenFromHell.pdf#page=8) is where the usage of Phantom Types pops up.
